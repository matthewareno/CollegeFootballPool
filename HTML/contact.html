<p>Greetings football star!</p>
<p>If you need to contact me, you know who I am.  Therefore, I have zero intention of putting my email address up on this site for all the world to see.  Call it selfish, but I'm not a fan of SPAM messages.  So, if you need to contact me, hit me on Facebook or email and I will respond.  If you don't have my contact info, just email our football leader and he will forward on your message.
