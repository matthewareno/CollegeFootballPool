<b>NEW FEATURES!!!!</b><br />
Sorry about the delay, but in case you didn't notice over the last couple of days, the 'Standings' page has been updated to 
reflect all the challenges that Dave sets up.  Also, after you have entered your picks, you should see a button appear on the
'Picks' page just before it lists all your picks that says 'Compare'.  This will allow you to look at who you're up against
and how your picks varied.  Hopefully the comparison page isn't too difficult to understand, but if so, just shoot me an email
and I'll explain how it works.
<br /><br />
Also, all Pick and Standing webpages have been updated so that you can print them.  Just make sure that you have 'Print background
images' selected when you try to print the page.  This is an option that you should see after clicking 'File->Print' or hitting the
printer icon on your browser.  Every browser and operating system represents it differently, so it's impossible to tell you 
exactly what the option says for your computer, but it should include the world "background" and "print".  Again, if you have 
questions, shoot me an email and I'll see if I can figure out what the option is that you need.

<b>Help Me Videos</b><br />
Just to help out anyone who feels a little hesitant with our new website, I put together a short, 15-minute overview of the website 
to show what it provides and where to find anything for which you might be looking.  I also mention a few of the things I am still 
planning on adding to the website in the coming weeks, as well as Dave's new "battle strategy" for this year.
<br /><br />
There are three copies of the video available (Low resolution/Medium resolution/High resolution).  They all contain the exact same 
content, but are just different sizes.  What that means is that if you do not have a good internet connection, you will likely want to
just watch the Low resolution version, though it might be a bit fuzzy.  The others will be less fuzzy, but might take longer to 
download.  Feel free to try and see which on works best for you.
